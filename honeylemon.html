	<p><strong>Honey and lemons.</strong><br>
	 <p>They are amazing in so many ways. Now I am not a expert on either and I am not a Health Professional. What I am about to share is from personal experiance only.</p>
	<p>Okay. Lets talk about lemons first. I first found out about lemons because I have had kidney stones more than once and I do not ever want to have them again. I researched ways to avoid getting kidney stones and found lemons. They are very acidic and are believed to desolve kidney stones that have formed. Naturally, I jumped all over that. I am up to 6 full lemons a day. I drink them in a glass of water with a straw, so I don't damage the enamel on my teeth. From drinking all these lemons every day, I have not had a kidney stone in 7 years and I found out some other benefits.</p>

		<li><strong>Sickness</strong></li>
		<p>I rarley get sick anymore and if I do, I don't get hit with it as hard or as long.</p>
		<li><strong>Tummy issues</strong></li>
		<p>I used to get some really bad upset stomachs from some really good tasting food( I had more than I should have). The lemons cured that up. I still go to the bathroom but no more cramping and praying to be put out of my misery.
		I have read that lemons have many more benefits but these are the ones I know for sure that work for me and I am eternally greatful.<br>
		<p>Now onto honey. I found out about honey because I was having problems with acne. I read if you use a baking soda paste and then use honey afterwards, left on for atleast 30 min, your acne will go away and yes,yes it did. It also gets rid of dandruff, rashes, helps heal cuts, fights infections, takes away pain from cuts and is healthy when eaten too.</p>
		<p>Now, this is not the sugary honey sold at resturants or normal grocery stores. You need to buy the 100% pure unfiltered, uncooked honey. You then heat up a little bit of coconut oil and mix togther well. I usually use 1 tblsp of coconut oil to 2 cups of honey. You apply to cuts, burns and rashes and leave on atleast 30 min. You apply to hair the same way, and it will get rid of dandruff.</p>
		<p>I hope this will help anyone who has any of the problems listed above. Thank you for reading. &#x1f601 (kind of a scary smiley face)<br>
